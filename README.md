## High throughput sequencing data analysis 
[FOR SHOWCASE ONLY]

This library implements the mapping stage of a high throughput sequencing analysis pipeline. 

[1] src/bamqc.sh - implements quality checking for the sequencing files.
[2] src/align.sh - implements mapping using STAR aligner.
[3] src/fetch.sh - downloads sequencing data form the sequencing facility's server.


Note:  [1] Made to be run on UGA's scientific computing cluster.
       [2] This is for showcase purposes only. Confidential information has been redacted and many supporting files (e.g. the human genome) are referred to but missing.
